I had the pleasure recently of being <a href="http://joecolantonio.com/testtalks/35matt-wynne-bdd-and-the-cucumber-book/">interviewed by Joe Colantonio for the TestTalks podcast.</a>

We talked about acceptance testing, the difference between scrum and agile, and how to get developers interested in doing BDD or TDD. It's a great chance to hear my opinions about how Cucumber is intended to be used!
