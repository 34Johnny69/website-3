[CukenFest London](https://cukenfest.cucumber.io) will take place on April 17th-20th 2018 in Shoreditch. It's our small and intimate conference for the BDD, Cucumber and Agile community. 

And right now, you can submit to our [Call for Proposals](http://cukenfest.cucumber.io/call-for-papers). We're looking for talks about building shared understanding, software design, continuous delivery, or frankly anything which will delight an intellectually curious, role-diverse audience. 

There will also be a very special birthday at the conference next year: Cucumber will turn 10 years old. To celebrate, we want to go back to our roots and hear about the technical practices which underpin successful BDD projects.* If you have a talk along those lines, we want to hear it. 

Learn more about the CfP and what we're looking for on the [CukenFest website](https://cukenfest.cucumber.io/call-for-papers). 

If you have a theme or idea you want explored at the conference, please write to us in the comments or jump into the [Cucumber Slack Cukenfestees channel](https://cucumberbdd-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) 

* *We will also celebrate with song and cake.*
