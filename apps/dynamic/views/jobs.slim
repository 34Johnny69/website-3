          | The site at
          a<> href="http://cukes.info"  http://cukes.info
          | needs a refresh. Several thousand people visit every day, yet the site has hardly changed since it was first put up in 2009.
        p
          | As many people's first impression of Cucumber, it's vital to our community and business that this site meets our users needs by providing easy access to information about Cucumber, BDD and the surrounding eco-system of tools, training and other support.
        p
          | Usability is top priority, but we also want the site to look beautiful.
        p
          | We've started the process of re-imagining the content and purpose of the site, from a user-centred perspective. We understand the main tasks and have sketched out some personas.

        p
          | We'd like you to help us design and implement the new site. You'll be supported by the Cucumber core team, but you'll get plenty of creative freedom to fulfil the brief.
        p
          | Your strengths are design, HTML and CSS. You're happy to work with real users to understand their needs, test your designs on them, and iterate.
        p
          | You have at least an awareness of Cucumber and the BDD process. Ideally you're already a user of Cucumber yourself, and keen to immerse yourself in creating an amazing resource for other users.
        p

          a<> href="https://github.com"  GitHub
          | for collaboration. You're happy working on your own, and setting your own goals and priorities, but you also know when to ask for help.
