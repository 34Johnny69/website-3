Some exciting news.

All the talks from [CukeUp London](http://cukenfest.cucumber.io/video/) are now on our website. 

At the end of June under the bricked arches of Shoreditch's Village Underground, around 150 of us gathered together for a day of inspiring talks and discussions about building high-quality software by harnessing the power of collaboration. 

Throughout the day we witnessed a series of tactical and informative talks from practitioners, business leaders and industry-renowned authors. Talks topics weren't limited to just Cucumber or BDD, instead each focused on how to bridge the communication gap between business and IT teams.
