In the past couple of years, lots of software teams have been using a simple collaborative technique called Example Mapping to break down user stories. It was conceived co-founder of Cucumber, Matt Wynne, who wrote the seminal [post introducing the practice](https://cucumber.io/blog/2015/12/08/example-mapping-introduction).

In this recorded webinar the creator of Cucumber, Aslak Helles√∏y, introduces Example Mapping and answers a few questions with colleague Steve Tooke at the end.

As Matt puts it, "Example Mapping helps you zoom in and focus on the smallest pieces of behaviour inside your story. By mapping it out you can tease apart the rules, find the core of the behaviour you want, and defer the rest until later. With this level of scrutiny, example mapping acts like a filter, preventing big fat stories from getting into your sprint and exploding."
