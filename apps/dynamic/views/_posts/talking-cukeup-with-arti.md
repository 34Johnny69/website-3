With just two weeks to go until [CukeUp! London (June 23rd)](http://cukenfest.cucumber.io/) I've spent some time catching up with a few people involved in the conference this year. My first conversation is with Arti Mathanda, who has made an enormous difference to the essence of CukeUp! since joining our programme committee a couple of years ago. 

> Hi Arti! We’ve been friends for ages but I’m not sure all of our readers will know you so well. Can you tell us a bit about your background? How did you get into the software industry?

I kinda just stumbled into the software industry. My dream as a kid was to be a flight attendant so that I could make loads of money while travelling the world. I tried it for 3 months & HATED it. So much for childhood dreams! 

Later on, for various reasons I had to move to the US and I decided to do a Masters degree there. I picked Computing because I thought it was a safe bet career wise. Thankfully, I enjoyed what I got myself into!

> You’ve been helping me pull together the programme and general atmosphere at CukeUp for a few years now. Do you remember why you agreed to get involved in the first place? How have you seen the conference change since then?
 
I can't remember how exactly I got involved in helping with CukeUp. I know why I do it though. I often despair at the lack of representation of minorities in the industry and wanted to actually do something about it. Helping with CukeUp meant that I got to do exactly that. It's quite amazing the strides we've made. I want to be careful not to get complacent and pat ourselves on our backs but the diversity of our speakers (and attendants) has gotten better with every year & the line up this year is just fantastic.

> How would you describe CukeUp to someone who’s never been before?
 
CukeUp is a welcoming community event where you get to learn about different aspects of what makes a software product team perform and tick. This includes code, tests, collaboration and arguably most importantly - culture.


> From your experience, what do you think is the secret to getting effective communication happening between business and technical people?
 
Literally just talk to one another! All too often I see teams where the business stakeholders have no time to spend with the product team and all the communications happen via disjointed emails. 

If your product is important to you - go sit with your development team. If you can't do it all day, do it for a few hours a day. 
If you want to build the right thing in the right way for your business, insist on regular face time. 

And this applies to remote & distributed teams as well. There are tools to collaborate effectively in a virtual environment.

It's quite magical what happens when you make all involved parties sit together and collaborate.
