[CukeUp 2015](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6332-cukeup-2015) will be held at the Skills Matter eXchange in London on Thursday March 26th-27th 2015.

The call for papers will open soon, but first we're opening a call for *thoughts*. We want to hear your thoughts about what would make the next CukeUp the best.

What themes are dominant for you right now in how we make software? What's getting you excited? Who would you love to see speak or run a workshop at CukeUp, and on what topic?

Don't worry about rambling, incoherent nonsense. We want to hear all your ideas!

Please write in the comments, or [email the team](mailto:cukeup@skillsmatter.com).
