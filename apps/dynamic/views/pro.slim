        | To deliver certain and predictable software, business and tech teams 
        | need to speak to one another. The development team needs to know they 
        | are building the right thing, and the business needs to feel capable of 
        | shaping the behaviour of the software.
      p 
        | By bridging the communication gap between business and tech, 
        | organisations save time and money, otherwise lost to delays, 
        | misunderstandings, and poor quality.
      p 
        | Cucumber Pro helps lift the conversations happening in the codebase and 
        | makes them visible and accessible to the business.
