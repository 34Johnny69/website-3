Can XP improve the experiences of women software developers? Clare Sudbery certainly thinks so. Earlier this year, she wrote a paper about her own experiences in an XP team and how it impacted her.

In the podcast we discuss the ideas found in her paper and what progressive teams can do to improve their own working environment.

Clare's academic paper can be found [here](link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/â€¦3-319-33515-5_24)
