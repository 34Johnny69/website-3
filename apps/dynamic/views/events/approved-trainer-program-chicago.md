## BDD Kickstart - Approved Trainer Program

The demand for our BDD training and coaching in the US is growing year-on-year. To deliver the highest possible quality of training, we are building a small pool of approved trainers to use our materials. Attending this 3-day workshop is the first stage in our Approved Trainer Program. Read the [description of the program](https://cucumber.io/training/ApprovedTrainerProgramDescription.pdf) to see if it's something you are interested in.

If you would like to apply to join the program, please complete the [application form](https://cucumber.io/training/ApprovedTrainerProgramApplication.pdf) and upload it, along with your resum√©, via our [Typeform](https://cucumber.typeform.com/to/wlhmKk?code=Boston2017). The application fee is $150, which is non-refundable. If you are accepted, you will be given a free invitation to attend our BDD Kickstart course followed by a one-day trainers workshop.

The submission deadline is May 1st 2018.
