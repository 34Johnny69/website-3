On May 2nd-3rd we are running a two-day [BDD Kickstart training](https://cucumber.io/events/bdd-kickstart-houston) in Houston, Texas. It's our first public course in the US for a number of years and we're excited for our long overdue return. 

For five years we've improved and iterated on our flagship training course. Developers, testers, BAs and product owners can all grasp the fundamental skills of implementing Cucumber and BDD in this world-class training. 

The course focuses on how you can reap the benefits of closer collaboration between business and IT as well as a solid introduction to TDD and using Cucumber to drive your development. 

Thousands of teams around the world are benefiting from precise and predictable software which BDD delivers. 

**Early-bird tickets run until midnight on Thursday April 6th.**
