We're two weeks out from CukeUp! AU landing in Sydney. It's our second visit to Australia in as many years and we're looking forward to our return. Since 2011, we've been running various CukeUp! conferences around the world; we ran a couple in New York - with another in the works for ‘17 - and each Spring we run the original in London. 

In the early years, in the old shabby offices of Skills Matter on Goswell road, the conference was a meeting point for those interested in the small, but rapidly growing, Cucumber open-source project. It was a chance to put names to faces and discuss these new, evoloving ideas found in Behaviour-Driven Development. 

The conference had a technical flavour, with lots of content reserved for developers and testers. Nowadays it’s less about the particular tools you use, more about helping you deliver higher quality software - regardless of name or association. And really, the purpose of the conference, the OSS tool, and now the company is the same. We want to find ways to bridge the communication gap between business and IT. 

At CukeUp! AU this year, we'll be tackling this head on. Short talks - and even shorter lightning talks - will be weaved between practical workshops. One minute you'll be learning about remote collaboration and next, improving the way your team write scenarios. 

Running CukeUp! is always a delight. We cherish the little moments at these small events where you can bump into speakers and share coffee with your peers. If you’re looking for new ideas to bring together your team to deliver high quality, predictable software, CukeUp! is full of inspiring ideas and practical takeaways. 

If you purchase your ticket today or tomorrow, we will enroll you onto Cucumber School - our online training - for free.
