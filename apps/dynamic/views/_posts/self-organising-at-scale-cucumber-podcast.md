This week we’re speaking to Loomio co-founder and Enspiral member, Richard Bartlett. In 2011, Richard found himself at the heart of the Occupy movement in Wellington, New Zealand. For the first couple of months, the camp was growing 20% per day, and no one was driving it. Although Occupy ultimately collapsed, Richard, along with some others from the movement, continued to explore how organisations and groups can self organise at scale.

We cover Richard’s own background and feed these ideas back into how software teams can spark change even in the largest companies.
