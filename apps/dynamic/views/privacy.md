# Cucumber Limited Privacy Policy

Cucumber Limited websites (collectively “Cucumber Limited” in this document) refer to sites hosted on the cucumber.io, cucumber.pro and other related domains and subdomains thereof.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Cucumber Limited collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Cucumber Limited’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Cucumber Limited’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Cucumber Limited may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Cucumber Limited also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Cucumber Limited does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Cucumber Pro Appliance Customers

When you purchase a license for a Cucumber Pro appliance, we will store personal information about you in order to be able to contact you about your account, e.g. to send you invoices. All billing data such as credit card information is stored with a third party service. Your specifications themselves, and any data about individual users are stored on your own infrastructure where you have installed the appliance.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Cucumber Limited choose to interact with Cucumber Limited in ways that require Cucumber Limited to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Cucumber Limited gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email address. In each case, Cucumber Limited collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Cucumber Limited. Cucumber Limited does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

Cucumber Limited may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors to its websites. For instance, Cucumber Limited may reveal how many downloads a particular version got. However, Cucumber Limited does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Cucumber Limited discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organisations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Cucumber Limited’s behalf or to provide services available at Cucumber Limited, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organisations may be located outside of your home country; by using Cucumber Limited, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Cucumber Limited will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organisations, as described above, Cucumber Limited discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Cucumber Limited believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Cucumber Limited, third parties, or the public at large. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Cucumber Limited takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorised access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Cucumber Limited uses cookies to help Cucumber Limited identify and track visitors, their usage of Cucumber Limited, and their website access preferences. Cucumber Limited visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Cucumber Limited’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Cucumber Limited’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
You will continue to receive advertising material but it will not be tailored to your interests.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Cucumber Limited may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Cucumber Limited’s sole discretion. Cucumber Limited encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
