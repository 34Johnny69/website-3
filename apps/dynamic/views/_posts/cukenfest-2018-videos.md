Last month we ran our annual BDD and Agile conference, [CukenFest London](http://cukenfest.cucumber.io/). For two days, talks and discussions focussed on how software teams can build stronger ties between business and IT. 

And today we're pleased to share the opening keynote of the conference from Dan North. Dan's best known as the originator of the term "Behaviour-Driven Development" and he spoke about how to break the rules, referencing Eliyahu Goldratt's seminal book "The Goal".
