Happy OSS Friday readers!

I've just released Cucumber-Ruby 2.1. You can read the full changelog [here](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/blob/master/History.md#v21).

There are two significant changes in this release worth knowing about. The first is the new [Events](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/cucumber/Cucumber/Events) API, and the second is the change to the shiny new [Gherkin3](http://github.com/cucumber/gherkin3) parser.

The headline news from those is that Windows users should be able install Cucumber on modern Rubies again, and people can start playaing with and giving us feedback on the new events API which we plan on being the recommended method for implementing formatters.

More details on those in future blog posts!
