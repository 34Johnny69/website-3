# BDD Fundamentals - 2 day BDD training

By the end of our BDD Fundamentals training you will have a strong understanding of the techniques and tools associated with BDD and be able to explain the benefits to your colleagues. 

This course is based on proven and practical techniques, which we've taught to hundreds of ambitious teams around the world. If you are considering implementing Behaviour-Driven Development practices into your team, this is the ideal course for you. 

Both days are led by **Seb Rose**, an accomplished trainer, coaching and author of *[The Cucumber Book for Java](https://pragprog.com/book/srjcuc/the-cucumber-for-java-book)* and *[Discovery](https://leanpub.com/bddbooks-discovery)*. 

Download our [BDD Benefits PDF](https://cucumber.io/bdd-benefits.pdf) to learn more about how BDD can impact your business.

## BDD Fundamentals - Day 1 and 2

We involve the whole team (BAs, product owners, domain experts, UX designers, developers, testers, and any other important stakeholders).

In this module we give an in-depth introduction to BDD, which is the process that Cucumber supports. There is no automation on these day; the focus is on analysis and collaboration techniques. 

We’ll teach you Example Mapping - a powerful technique we have developed to help business, IT and QA break requirements down into concrete examples. This exposes misunderstandings early and will help you write better executable specifications and automated tests later.

### Learning outcomes

* The fundamental principles and practices of BDD
* The importance of Rules and Examples
* Translating examples into Gherkin - Cucumber’s format for executable specifications
* Conversation patterns for discovering edge cases
* The importance of a ubiquitous language for problems and solutions
* Using Example Mapping and Discovery Workshops to achieve shared understanding
* Roles and responsibilities on a BDD team

### Delegates will benefit from

- Increased confidence, due to extensive practical exercises
- Deeper understanding, through guided discussions
- Smoother collaboration, by building an understanding of how BDD practices can best be incorporated into their own development process
- Improved productivity, from experiencing and overcoming common obstacles before returning to the workplace


## BDD with Cucumber (Further online training)

Each attendee of our BDD Fundamentals class will also receive access to our online training module, BDD with Cucumber, including a detailed workbook with exercises you can practice at your own pace. 

This module is a solid introduction to Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber. You will learn to write executable specifications with Gherkin - Cucumber’s plain-text format for automated tests. You will also learn how to use Cucumber to drive the development of a system, and see the design of the system gradually emerge. You’ll end up with a system that does the right thing, and is easy to test.

This online training is designed for developers and testers, non-technical people are welcome, but they may find things start to get beyond their comfort zone.

### Learning outcomes
* Installing Cucumber and setting up your development environment
* The TDD / BDD cycle
* Writing your first scenario
* Writing step definitions
* Using parameters in step definitions
* Techniques to keep your test code clean
* Backgrounds, Tags, Tables, Scenario Outlines and other Gherkin tricks
* Domain modelling by Example
* Costs & benefits of working test-first
