Seb Rose argues Behaviour-Driven Development is made of three separate practices; discovery, formulation, automation. The first practice, *Discovery*, is the subject of his [latest book](http://bddbooks.com/discovery). 

Many teams who use Cucumber miss out the discovery practice all together and lose out on the benefits of discovering bugs and misunderstandings early, often before any code is even written. In this webinar recording, Seb Rose talks about the first practice of BDD and describes our preferred approach.
