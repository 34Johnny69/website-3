This is a conversation between Matt Wynne and Suzan Bond. They talk about the founding of Cucumber (the company) and the many mistakes that have happened along the way. Suzan is a great host and it makes for an interesting conversation. 

If you're just interested in the decisions the team made when building [Cucumber Pro](https://cucumber.io/pro), jump in around the 18 minute mark.
