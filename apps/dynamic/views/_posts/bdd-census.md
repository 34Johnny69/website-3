Cucumber's download numbers are increasing every year, and that tells us that
popularity is growing.

What we don't know much about is **how** BDD and Cucumber is being used in various
places.

To understand this better we have prepared a [survey with a bunch of questions](https://cucumber.typeform.com/to/kjrSc2?audience=blog).
We'll leave that up for a few weeks and then prepare a nice report.

We'd love to hear how BDD & Cucumber are used on your team. It only takes 7-8 minutes
to fill out, and in return we'll send you the final report when it's ready.
