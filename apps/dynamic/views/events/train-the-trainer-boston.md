## BDD Kickstart - Train the Trainer

The demand for our BDD training and coaching in the US is growing year-on-year. To deliver the highest possible quality of training, we entrust a small pool of trainers to use our materials. Our intention with this one-day workshop is to introduce and teach the BDD Kickstart training to a new group of trainers who we can call upon. 

The application fee is $150. If you are accepted, you will be invited to attend our BDD Kickstart course and a one-day trainers workshop. Your place is not guaranteed and you must apply via our [Typeform](https://cucumber.typeform.com/to/wlhmKk?code=xxxxx).
