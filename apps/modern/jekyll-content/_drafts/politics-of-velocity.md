When agile practices meet a low-trust organisational culture, those practices can become worse than useless.

In [this excellent post](http://blog.gdinwiddie.com/2014/03/04/tracking-velocity/), George Dinwiddie notes:

>> Goodhartâ€™s Law: Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.

- trust your people
- make it OK for them to give you bad news
- treat velocity like the weather - don't try to control it
- use burn-ups to track rate of learning as well as rate of work completed
