We've just released what we expect to be the final release candidate for Cucumber 2.0. As far as we're concerned, it's [perfect](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/milestones/2.0)

Please update your Gemfile to test it out:

```ruby
gem "cucumber", "2.0.0.rc.5"
```

Let us know if you experience any issues, either with Cucumber itself or any related tools that you use with it.

Thanks to Steve Tooke, Bjorn Rasmusson, Richard Adams and everyone else who's been mucking in with bug reports and fixes.
