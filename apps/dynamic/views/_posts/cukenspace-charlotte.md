It's just a little under a month until we host our not for profit Behaviour-Driven Development
conference, [CukenSpace Charlotte](https://cucumber.io/events/2018/12/12/cukenspace-charlotte).

Since 2011 we've run a similar much-loved event in London which will now cross the pond. We all know the benefits of when testers, developers, and business analysts work together well. The team discovers misunderstandings early, avoiding costly bugs later on, the team relies on the skills of the whole team, things aren't just lumped with one side of the silo. Teams which practice BDD effectively end up delivering higher-quality software which arrives to the customer on time and in budget. CukenSpace is a conference which brings together the diverse mix of a modern agile software team to explore innovative ways to crack complex software problems.

We deliberately cap attendance to allow conversations and inspired thoughts to drift easily through the room. There's no talking down to, no enterprise sales demos, and no stale sandwiches. CukenSpace will be a comfortable and welcoming space for those curious about the possibilities BDD can bring to their organization. 

Our keynote session will come from [Ellen Gottesdiener](https://twitter.com/ellengott), author of [Discover to Deliver](http://www.discovertodeliver.com/), while [Matt Wynne](https://twitter.com/mattwynne), [Steve Tooke](https://twitter.com/@tooky), [Marlena Compton](https://twitter.com/marlenac), [George Dinwiddie](https://twitter.com/gdinwiddie) are just some of the names to be running and attending sessions.

When the conference is over and we've picked up the all sticky notes and pens, you will leave with a strong sense about how you can deliver higher-quality software with a new set of techniques which have proven to reduce misunderstandings and costly
production bugs. You'll also acquire a strong network of other practitioners facing the same challenges which you can draw upon, long after the conference doors close. CukenSpace is a great place to catch your breath, find innoative ways to tackle some of the hardest problems in software and head back to the office with a renewed sense of what is possible.

There will be sessions on how you can use techniques like [Example Mapping](https://cucumber.io/blog/2015/12/08/example-mapping-introduction) to break down your user stories, how to priortise your product backlog through structured conversations, how BDD practices can be applied in legacy systems and why the values of agile software development and BDD are more important than ever.

Just prior to CukenSpace, we will host a two-day [BDD Kickstart training class](https://cucumber.io/events/2018/12/11/bdd-kickstart-charlotte) which will teach you all the technical and non-technical skills you need to start practising in your own context.

We hope you can join us in Charlotte NC next month. Gonna be a whole lot of fun.
