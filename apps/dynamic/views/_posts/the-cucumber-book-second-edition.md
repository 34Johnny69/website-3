Here are a few reviews from The Cucumber Book. 

*Few tools have managed to bridge the developer-customer divide as well as Cucumber has. Cucumber is not a tool for testing applications. Cucumber is a philosophy for communicating requirements. This book brings that philosophy to life.*

Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)

*I devoured the Cucumber book on a train ride from Grenoble to Brussels a few days after watching Matt’s presentation “BDD As It’s Meant to Be Done.” These two resources helped me understand in just a few hours how to avoid dozens of common mistakes writing scenarios in the Cucumber style. It’s as though I received an injection of perhaps two years of experience writing scenarios poorly so that I didn’t have to go through it all myself. What a gift. I recommend this book to everyone working with Cucumber.*

J. B. Rainsberger, Author "JUnit Recipes"

*Teams can use Cucumber to get a better understanding of what software to build for their customers. In this book, Aslak and Matt do a brilliant job explaining how you get started with Cucumber with plenty of easy-to-follow examples.*

Rachel Davies, Author "Agile Coaching"
