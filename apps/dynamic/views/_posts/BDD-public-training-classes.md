Many management teams don't know what it feels like to practice Behaviour-Driven Development. 

They might acknowledge the benefits BDD promises on paper, but they can't reconcile a wholesale change in approach with the realities of delivering software to a budget and deadline. 

Any change like this can can seem daunting. It can often require plenty of time and money to train the team in these new skills and the space to make mistakes and slow down before speeding up.

It is, in short, a difficult sell. 

That's why a few times a year we carve out time in the training schedule to run a few BDD public courses. We regularly talk to individuals within departments who have heard about BDD or even experienced what it feels like in a previous company and now want to see it in their own environment. 

Public classes allow you to see it for yourself, with the whole investment needed to transform your organisation. This training is intended for developers, testers and anyone from the business who wants to learn the fundamentals of BDD, meet others in a similar situation and learn practises which you can use in your current projects which will build shared understanding. 

Our final course in London has now sold-out. But you can purchase a ticket to our London course here or sign-up for updates for our BDD Kickstart course in Boston.
