The reality is many management teams don't know what it feels like to practice Behaviour-Driven Development. 

They might acknowledge the benefits BDD promises on paper, but they can't reconcile a wholesale change in approach with the realities of delivering software to a budget and deadline. 

A change like this can seem daunting. It requires plenty of time and money to train the team in these new skills and the space to make mistakes and slow down before speeding up.

It is, in short, a difficult sell. 

That's why a few times a year we carve out time in the training schedule to run a few BDD public courses. 

Public classes allow you to experience it for yourself, without the expense of an on-site class. This training is perfect for developers, testers and anyone from the business who wants to learn the fundamentals of BDD, meet others in a similar situation, and confidently explain the benefits of BDD to colleagues and maangement.

Our final course of the year in London has now sold-out. But you can sign-up for updates for our [Boston course in February](https://cucumber.io/events/bdd-kickstart-boston-18) or our [London course in April.](https://cucumber.io/events/bdd-kickstart-london-2018)
