In traditional requirements documentation, you'd often have to keep a version history of your documents, showing who had changed it, when and why.

With living documentation, that information is all available in your source control repository, but it's not always easy to access or make sense of if you're not a developer.

Cucumber Pro's new _History_ feature allows you to save off a specific revision of your living documentation, presenting it in a History view where you can compare the changes between releases. Soon, we'll be adding test results to this view too, so you can visualise the return on all that investment you're making in test automation.

Like what you see? We're looking for teams to join our [early access program](https://cucumber.typeform.com/to/am3RAI) to test-drive Cucumber Pro.
