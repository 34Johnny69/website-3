      p CukeUp is small and friendly. You'll be inspired by great speakers one minute, then sitting next to them in a fun, hands-on workshop the next. We work hard to create a great atmosphere where ideas can flourish.

      p A two-day conference in Sydney for people who care about building better software. Cucumber helps teams to collaborate. CukeUp brings those people together to educate and inspire one another.

      p Each day has a beginning, a middle, and an end. People learn in different ways, so we mix things up, with 90-minute workshops sandwiched inbetween punchy 25-minute talks. You're never bored.

    h2 Behaviour-Driven Development

    p BDD is a set of practices that enables teams to produce more valuable software with fewer bugs. It helps communicate requirements with more precision, discover defects early and produce software that remains maintainable over time.

    p CukeUp is a conference for anyone who wants to get better at BDD.

    h1 The Venue
    p We believe that being in an inspiring space helps to inspire great ideas.

    p We host in old factories and prisons, not hotels or stuffy function rooms.

    h1 Previous Years
    p In the 5 years that CukeUp has been running in London and NYC, we've had a diverse group of speakers and attendees: <strong>Product owners, business analysts, testers and programmers</strong>. You are all fundamental to making BDD work, and our programme reflects that.

    p Here are some of our favourite talks from previous years.
