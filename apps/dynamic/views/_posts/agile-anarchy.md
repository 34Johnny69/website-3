The wide adoption of agile has produced practices and tools that help teams communicate and deliver software effectively. But many activities we assume we *must* use don't add the value we hoped.

What happens when you throw out the rulebook and start at zero - will we see a marked improvement or just a Hobbesian mess?

We've invited Marcin Floryan and Seb Lambla on the pod to talk about their recent anarchic experiments at Spotify. What did they throw away and what did they keep. SPOILER - The planning meeting is first to go.
