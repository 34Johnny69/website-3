It's taken us a while, but we're pleased to share the CukeUp AU 2016 videos with you. We've had some boring problems getting the files from our AV guy, but that's all behind us now. You can now feast yourself on some high-quality BDD and Cucumber content.

CukeUp AU was a single-track two-day conference focused on helping teams discover ways to bridge the communication gap between business and IT. Short talks were mixed with collaborative workshops designed to bring BAs, developers and testers together to build higher-quality software. 

You'll find some golden advice in each talk, but here's a few you should start with. 

### Katrina Clokie: We just want chocolate

Katrina delivered an entertaining talk about how initial enthusiasm for BDD can fizzle out. You'll learn where your current process fits in the model, simple ideas to drive movement through the lifecycle by creating change in your team, and some reassuring words that building high-quality software isn't easy.
