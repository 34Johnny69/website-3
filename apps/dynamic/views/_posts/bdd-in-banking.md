This month on the Cucumber podcast, Matt Wynne speaks to Simon Powers the founder of Adventures with Agile about Behaviour-Driven Development in banking. 

Simon was approached by the global investment bank BNP Paribas to review several product teams and to find out why the teams could not complete stories at the end of each sprint and why there was so many defects coming into the sprint. 

In just 9 months the defect rate decreased from 34% to 4% and they avoided a very costly rewrite. Listen to this podcast to hear how they did it and the lessons learned along the way.

Simon's story can also be found on the [Adventures with Agile blog](https://www.adventureswithagile.com/2015/08/27/a-case-study-for-bdd-in-improving-throughput-and-collaboration/)
