This is a conversation between [Matt Wynne](https://twitter.com/mattwynne) and [Suzan Bond](https://twitter.com/suzanbond). Matt talks about the early product mistakes they made, why they threw away a two-year old codebase and started over, and why a strong focus on technology was their blindspot. 

Suzan is a great host and it makes for an interesting conversation. 

If you're just interested in the decisions the team made when building [Cucumber Pro](https://cucumber.io/pro), jump in around the 18 minute mark.
