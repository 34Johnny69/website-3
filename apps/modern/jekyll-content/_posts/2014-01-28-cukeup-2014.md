Cucumber has had its own conference since 2010. This year, based on your feedback, we've expanded CukeUp to two days packed with talks and workshops.

The Cucumber community is constantly growing, and this year we welcome two new official members - [Behat/PHP](http://behat.org/) and [SpecFlow/.NET](http://www.specflow.org/).

You’ll meet Konstantin and Gaspar, the developers behind those two frameworks, as well as Aslak, Matt and Julien from the Cucumber-JVM, Ruby and Javascript core team.

Other confirmed sessions include Liz Keogh as well as Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce, authors of Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests.

## Not just for geeks

CukeUp isn’t just for geeks. Product owners, testers and business analysts are fundamental to making BDD work, and our programme reflects that.

That’s why we’ve added a full day of hands-on workshops. The workshops will allow you to get into depth about the aspects of BDD and Specification by Example that interest you the most.

## Call for papers

We're looking for session submissions from everyone in the BDD community. If you're a team who're just getting started on your journey towards executable specifications, we'd love you to come and tell your story. If you're pushing the boundaries, making the untestable testable with crazy new techniques, we want to hear from you too.
