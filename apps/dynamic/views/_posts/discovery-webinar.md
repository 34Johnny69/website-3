The first practice of Behaviour-Driven Development is discovery. At this stage, while bugs are cheap, you can air out differences and misunderstandings with representatives from business, dev, and test. On August 22nd, [Seb Rose](https://twitter.com/sebrose), co-author of [Discovery](http://bddbooks.com/discovery), will deliver a short webinar on simple tactics you can harness to build higher-quality software. 

Seb will stick around after for a short Q&A. 

Attendance is capped, so [sign up here](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/4415323492636/WN_Vi-ZANzjSwamPM-F1HNFqQ) to guarantee your place. 

P.S [join us on Slack](https://cucumber.io/support#slack) to discuss the discovery practice in more detail.

Cya there people.
