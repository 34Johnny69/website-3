It's taken us a while, but we're pleased to share the CukeUp AU 2016 videos with you. We had some boring problems getting the files from our AV guy, but that's all over now. You can now feast yourself on some high-quality BDD and Cucumber content. 

Watch all the talks on our [YouTube channel.](<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLrQMyTCtW0Daafumvs3aajoJoe0X3sgnT" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>)

CukeUp AU was a single-track two day event focused on helping teams find ways to bridge the communication gap between business and IT. Talks were mixed in with collaborative workshops designed to bring BAs, developers and testers together to build higher-quality software. 

You'll find some golden advice in each talk, but here's a few you should start with. 

### Katrina Clokie: We just want chocolate

Katrina delivered an entertaining talk about how initial enthusiasm for BDD has fizzled out. You'll learn where your current process fits in the model, ideas to drive movement through the lifecycle by creating change in your team, and reassurance to the battle-hardened that you are not alone in your experiences with BDD.

### Elise Aplin: Can the real MVP please stand up?
