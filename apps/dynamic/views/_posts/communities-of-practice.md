Today we’re going to be talking about communities of practice and exploring how they can support learning in your company. Communities of practice are “formed by people who engage in a process of collective learning in a shared domain of human endeavor”. [1]

In the organisations we work with, we encourage those with similar skill sets - testers for example - to get together with others in similar roles, who work in different departments. This wider pool of individuals can then support one another in their day-to-day work.

It could therefore be said agile faces a paradox; we've battled for smaller, cross-functional teams to improve communication and learning, but are we forfeiting wider collaboration?

Communities of Practice is the fightback.

To join us to discuss the subject we’ve invited [Emily Webber](https://twitter.com/ewebber), an independent agile and lean consultant, who has recently published her book “Building Successful Communities of Practice”. This week’s host, [Matt Wynne](https://twitter.com/mattwynne), is also joined by our podcast regulars, [Arti Mathanda](https://twitter.com/artismarti) and [Seb Rose](https://twitter.com/sebrose).
