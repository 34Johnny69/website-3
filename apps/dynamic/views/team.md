Matt is one of the world's leading BDD practitioners. A programmer, coach, trainer and popular international speaker, he was invited to join the Cucumber core team in 2009. Together with Aslak Hellesøy, he's co-author of [The Cucumber Book, Behaviour-Driven Development for Developers and Testers](https://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc2/the-cucumber-book-second-edition) and a co-founder of Cucumber Ltd.

**What has been the industry’s response to BDD?**

We’re seeing a “second wave” of agile adoption, where organisations have learned the basic moves of Scrum – daily stand-ups, user stories, story points – but they’re still seeing problems. Problems like a lack of predictability – things usually take longer than they estimated, sometimes quite a lot longer. They’ve noticed that there are often communication problems – developers misunderstanding requirements, for example, or business people being too busy to talk to the developers to a necessary level of depth. There are also quality problems – defects – that are leaking out regularly into production or only being caught by manual testing.

These are the organisations who are now discovering that they need to up their game, and look to BDD as a solution to these problems.

Aslak is the creator of Cucumber. He co-wrote [The Cucumber Book, Behaviour-Driven Development for Developers and Testers](https://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc2/the-cucumber-book-second-edition) with Matt Wynne. During his career Aslak has worked with both small and large organisations in several industries such as telecom, trading, banking, retail, insurance, car manufacturing, education and government. Aslak is a co-founder of Cucumber Ltd, the company behind Cucumber.

**How does the Cucumber tool add value to teams and organisations?**
It gives stakeholders with different roles and backgrounds a shared language for describing software behaviour. When teams use Cucumber, misunderstandings never manifest as software bugs, because Cucumber helps teams discover those misunderstandings and catch mistakes early - it shortens the feedback cycle.
