We’re on the lookout for inspiring talks and workshops for testers, devs, and product owners who think differently. CukeUp! continues to be the home for ideas and techniques which bridge the communication gap between business and IT. 

If you have a story of closer collaboration, a new technique or tool that has reduced bugs, or an exciting software project you'd like to share, we want to hear it. 

CukeUp! prides itself on being a friendly and welcoming event. If you haven’t spoken at a conference before, this is a great place to start. 

[Email us](mailto:cukeup-london@cucumber.io) if you have an idea for a talk but want some feedback before you submit. 

More details on the submission process can be found on the [CukeUp! website](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7606-cukeup-2016#get_involved). 

The Call for Papers ends on January 31st.
