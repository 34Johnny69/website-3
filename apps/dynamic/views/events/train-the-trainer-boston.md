## BDD Kickstart - Train the Trainer

The demand for our BDD training and coaching in the US is growing year-on-year. To deliver the highest possible quality of training, we work with a small pool of trusted trainers. Our intention with this one-day workshop is to introduce and teach the BDD Kickstart training to a new group of trainers who we can call upon to deliver our BDD training. 

This course costs $150. Included in the price is a seat on our BDD Kickstart course and this one-day workshop. Your place is not guaranteed and you must apply via our [Typeform](https://cucumber.typeform.com/to/wlhmKk?code=xxxxx).
