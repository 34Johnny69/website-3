I've just released a second beta for Cucumber 2.0. This fixes some bugs with the first beta which affected any project using Capybara, plus a couple of other issues.

As I write this, there are still [21 known issues](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2.0) with this release, but don't let that put you off taking it for a spin! Most of these are minor issues, and we really need your feedback to help get it ready for full release.

I'd especially like anyone who writes tools and plugins that depend on Cucumber to test out this release. We're trying hard to make 2.0 completely backwards compatible with 1.0, but we need feedback to know what we've missed.

If you'd like to help fix any of those issues, I'd also really appreciate it. Just ping @mattwynne on the GitHub ticket of your choice and I'll be glad to give you some [free BDD coaching](http://blog.mattwynne.net/2012/03/31/free-bdd-coaching/).
