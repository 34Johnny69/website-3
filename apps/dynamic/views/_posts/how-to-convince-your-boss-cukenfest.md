Cap in hand, you’re ready to approach your boss about attending [CukenFest London](http://cukenfest.cucumber.io/). 

Look, I don’t know your boss, but if you want to learn from experienced BDD practitioners; if you want to meet smart, like-minded people to talk about the challenges of building high-quality software; if you want to build relationships with other people who know that close collaboration between business and IT is a key part of success long term, CukenFest London is for you.

Here's what we're excited about:

Focused, informative short talks will provide you with insights about building great software. Expect to pick up at least one insight from each talk which you can try back in your team. 

A whole f***ing day of open-space. Our favourite conference format allows you, the attendee, to drive the agenda of the second day. We’ll undoubtedly talk about BDD, agility in large organisations, technical debt, you name it, you choose it. 

A return on your investment is inevitable. There's something Woody Zuill says about software, “The object isn’t to make great software, it’s to be in that wonderful state which makes great software inevitable”. We like to think the same way about running CukenFest. 

Fun for all the family. CukenFest reflects the modern software team, a mesh of people with different expertise and experiences to bring to the table. CukenFest is about bringing these people and ideas under one roof to discuss the biggest problems in delivering high-quality software.

Our line-up isn't exclusively big-name speakers. Sure, we've got them; Dan North, Ulrika Malmgren, Nat Pryce, Liz Keogh to name a few. But the talks which often prove to be just as surprising, insightful and informative are the lightning talks, the presentations from new speakers, those which approach problems in software with fresh eyes.

A perfect introduction to Behaviour-Driven Development. Right before the conference, we will run our two-day BDD Kickstart course. It’s a comprehensive introduction to the concepts, techniques and tools which make up BDD. What’s even better is you will be taught by the creator of Cucumber and author of The Cucumber Book, Aslak Hellesøy. 

Here are some concrete examples of attendees finding value in attending CukenFest:

It was the best conference I ever went to, no doubt. Great talks and an open space with inspiring participants.
CukenFest is a welcoming community event where you get to learn about different aspects of what makes a software product team perform and tick. This includes code, tests, collaboration and arguably most importantly - culture. *Tim Coremans, BNP Paribas*

We’ve only just started on the BDD journey and it’s easy to get a bit overwhelmed. I came back from CukenFest feeling re-energised - listening to the talks and talking to other people in the community reinforced for me that this is a mind shift for everyone involved. *Angela Relle, Met Office*


I’ve learned lots of useful techniques at CukenFest, even though the projects I’ve been involved in have rarely involved Cucumber. It’s about the techniques, not the technology. *Nat Pryce, author of Growing Object-Oriented Software: Guided by Tests*
