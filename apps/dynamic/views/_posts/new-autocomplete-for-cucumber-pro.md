Cucumber Pro has had autocompletion for a while now. Several of our users have told us that it's a useful feature, but that it [required too much setup](https://cucumber.io/blog/2014/01/25/a-sneak-peek-at-cucumber-pro.html) and wasn't very accurate.

So we redesigned it from scratch. Now there is *no* setup whatsoever[1]. The suggestions you get when you type are much better than before.

Just open a Feature file in Cucumber Pro, start typing a step and see the autocomplete show up with suggestions automatically. Use UP/DOWN keys to navigate, press ENTER/RETURN to choose a step or press ESC to dismiss the autocomplete.

Every time you save changes to your features into source control, weâ€™ll automatically refresh the autocomplete with your latest steps.

Because the new autocomplete works with pure Gherkin, it works with all the flavours of Cucumber projects: JVM, Ruby, JavaScript, SpecFlow for C# and Behat for PHP. If you're using JBehave with Gherkin, that should even work too.

[1] If you previously set up `.cucumber/stepdefs.json` you can remove it - it's not used anymore.
