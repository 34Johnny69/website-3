[CukenFest London](https://cukenfest.cucumber.io) will take place on April 17th-20th 2018 in Shoreditch. It's our small and intimate conference for the BDD, Cucumber and Agile community. 

Our Call for Proposals is now open. We want to see informative talks about building shared understanding, software design, continuous delivery, or anything that will delight a curious, role-diverse audience. 

At the conference next year, Cucumber will turn 10 years old. To celebrate, we want to go back to our roots and hear about the technical practices which underpin successful BDD projects.* If you have a talk along those lines, we want to hear it. 

Learn more about the CfP and what we're looking for on the [CukenFest website](https://cukenfest.cucumber.io/call-for-papers). 

If you have a theme or idea you want explored at the conference, please write to us in the comments or jump into the [Cucumber Slack Cukenfestees channel](https://cucumberbdd-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) 

*We will also celebrate with song and cake.
