Today we're pleased to announce we will run [three more BDD Kickstart classes](https://cucumber.io/events) towards the end of this year.

Our flagship BDD Kickstart course is a two-day training for teams looking to practice Behaviour-Driven Development in their next project. 

In the course you will be introduced to collaborative techniques like Example Mapping which help identify costly misunderstandings and build team trust. Attendees will get to experience what it feels like to work on a BDD project by taking a slice of a feature all the way through to implementation using Cucumber. 

Hundreds of software teams have already experienced this training first-hand. We've supported the likes of The Vanguard Group, Liberty IT, and the BBC in their efforts to build higher-quality software. Each course is taught by a member of the Cucumber core team or an experienced associate.

[Tickets will be available soon. Read more about the courses and register your interest.](https://cucumber.io/events)
