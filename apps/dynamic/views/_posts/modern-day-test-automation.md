On the podcast this month, Matt Wynne speaks to Angie Jones.

We first heard about Angie through her posts about BDD, Test Automation and Cucumber on her [website](https://angiejones.tech/). Her blog is a treat, filled with lots of practical advice for modern software teams.

Angie now works for Twitter as an Automation Engineer and is a frequent conference speaker.

### Here's what they discuss on the podcast:

 - Angie's background and her current role at Twitter.

 - Why developers shouldn't lead your automation efforts.

 - How testers can win over the team with BDD and Cucumber.

 - The future of testers in a world of automation.
