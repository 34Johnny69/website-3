The demand for our BDD training in the US is growing year-on-year. To match demand, we are looking to recruit a handful of trainers to join our small pool of trusted associates. On March 20th-22nd in Boston, we will run the first part of our first [Approved Trainer Program](https://cucumber.io/events/train-the-trainer-boston). 

This program is intended to identify a small pool of skilled professionals globally, to deliver our courses and coach teams during their adoption of BDD. We care greatly about the quality of training we provide, and so the program is intended to be challenging.

Full details of the Approved Trainers Program can be found on our [event page](https://cucumber.io/events/train-the-trainer-boston).
