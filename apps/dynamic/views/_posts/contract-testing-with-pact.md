This month on the Cucumber Podcast we speak to Beth Skurrie, who is the maintainer of the open-source project, Pact. Pact falls into the category of contract testing and with the advent of microservices and continuous delivery, it's getting more and more important.

Seb Rose takes the hosting duties with extra questions from Steve Tooke.
