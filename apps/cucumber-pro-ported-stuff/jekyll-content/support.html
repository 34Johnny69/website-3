          Thousands of organisations around the world use Cucumber to support their BDD and testing activities.
          While the Cucumber open source community is usually helpful and responsive, there is no guarantee
          that questions asked in the <a href="groups.google.com/group/cukes">community forum</a> will be
          answered in a timely manner - or answered at all.
          Cucumber Limitedâ€™s support plans guarantee expert answers in a timely manner.
