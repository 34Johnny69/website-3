Seb Rose argues Behaviour-Driven Development is made of three separate practices; discovery, formulation, automation. The first practice, *Discovery*, is the subject of his [latest book](http://bddbooks.com/discovery). 

Many teams who use Cucumber miss out the discovery practice all together and don't benefit from discovering bugs and misunderstandings early on, often before any code is even written. In this talk, Seb Rose talks about the first practice of BDD and describes our preferred approach.
